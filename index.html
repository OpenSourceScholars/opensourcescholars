	  <p>
	    <i>The Problem:</i> Paying for school is hard, when you're
	    finished you haven't learned enough skills to set you
	    apart from your peers, and your resume is unimpressive.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    This is a scholarship to motivate young adults to become
	    involved in open source communities.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Committee members working professionally in the open
	    source market will use their collective 30 years
	    experience to recommend students based on the impact of
	    their contributions.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    We'll show you what open source is all about: how to
	    negotiate the open source ecosystem, show you were to get
	    started, and walk you through your first contributions.
	  </p>
